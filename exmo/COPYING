jQuery JSON plugin 2.3.0

@author Brantley Harris, 2009-2011
@author Timo Tijhof, 2011-2012
@source This plugin is heavily influenced by MochiKit's serializeJSON, which is
        copyrighted 2005 by Bob Ippolito.
@source Brantley Harris wrote this plugin. It is based somewhat on the JSON.org
        website's http://www.json.org/json2.js, which proclaims:
        "NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.", a sentiment that
        I uphold.
