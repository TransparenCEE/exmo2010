License: CC-BY-SA
    THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE 
    COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY 
    COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS 
    AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED. 

    BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE 
    TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY 
    BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS 
    CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND 
    CONDITIONS. 

    1. Definitions 

    a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and 
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative 
    work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or 
    artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic 
    adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, 
    transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from 
    the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not 
    be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the 
    avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or 
    phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a 
    moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the 
    purpose of this License. 

    b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such 
    as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or 
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in 
    Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of 
    their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is 
    included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other 
    contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in 
    themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work 
    that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as 
    defined below) for the purposes of this License. 

    c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed 
    at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved 
    by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, 
    including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that 
    have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of 
    this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of 
    adaptations of works made available under that license under this 
    License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License 
    Elements as this License. 

    d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and 
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other 
    transfer of ownership. 

    e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes 
    as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: 
    Attribution, ShareAlike. 

    f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that 
    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License. 

    g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, 
    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or 
    if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in 
    addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, 
    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, 
    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or 
    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer 
    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a 
    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the 
    organization that transmits the broadcast. 

    h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the 
    terms of this License including without limitation any production in the 
    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or 
    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet 
    and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same 
    nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or 
    entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; 
    a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a 
    process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, 
    architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work 
    to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to 
    photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch 
    or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, 
    architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a 
    compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable 
    work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent 
    it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work. 

    i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this 
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with 
    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the 
    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous 
    violation. 

    j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work 
    and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means 
    or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital 
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that 
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place 
    individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any 
    means or process and the communication to the public of the performances 
    of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and 
    rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. 

    k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including 
    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of 
    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a 
    protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic 
    medium. 

    2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, 
    limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from 
    limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the 
    copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws. 

    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, 
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to 
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below: 

    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more 
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the 
    Collections; 

    b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such 
    Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable 
    steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes 
    were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be 
    marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a 
    modification could indicate "The original work has been modified."; 

    c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated 
    in Collections; and, 

    d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. 

    e. For the avoidance of doubt: 

    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in 
    which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory 
    licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive 
    right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights 
    granted under this License; 

    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which 
    the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory 
    licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right 
    to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted 
    under this License; and, 

    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect 
    royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a 
    member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing 
    schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights 
    granted under this License. 

    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now 
    known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make 
    such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights 
    in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not 
    expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved. 

    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly 
    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions: 

    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms 
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource 
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You 
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on 
    the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the 
    recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient 
    under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You 
    must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the 
    disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or 
    Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You 
    may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that 
    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the 
    rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This 
    Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but 
    this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be 
    made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, 
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, 
    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as 
    requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor 
    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any 
    credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. 

    b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the 
    terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with 
    the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons 
    jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that 
    contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., 
    Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible 
    License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses 
    mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If 
    you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses 
    mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must 
    comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the 
    following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, 
    the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute 
    or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the 
    Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the 
    ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights 
    granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; 
    (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable 
    License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work 
    as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) 
    when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not 
    impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that 
    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to 
    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the 
    Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as 
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection 
    apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the 
    Applicable License. 

    c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or 
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to 
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and 
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the 
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, 
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or 
    parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for 
    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, 
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or 
    parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent 
    reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be 
    associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the 
    copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , 
    consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit 
    identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French 
    translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on 
    original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 
    4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, 
    that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit 
    will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation 
    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at 
    least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. 
    For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this 
    Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, 
    by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or 
    explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or 
    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, 
    as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, 
    express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or 
    Attribution Parties. 

    d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be 
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or 
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations 
    or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other 
    derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to 
    the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those 
    jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted 
    in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be 
    deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory 
    action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the 
    Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the 
    fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You 
    to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License 
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. 

    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer 

    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR 
    OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY 
    KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, 
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, 
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF 
    LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, 
    WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE 
    EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE 
    LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR 
    ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES 
    ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS 
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

    7. Termination 

    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. 
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections 
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses 
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full 
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will 
    survive any termination of this License. 

    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here 
    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). 
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the 
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at 
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to 
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is 
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this 
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as 
    stated above. 

    8. Miscellaneous 

    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a 
    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work 
    on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under 
    this License. 

    b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor 
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms 
    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. 

    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under 
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action 
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to 
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and 
    enforceable. 

    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no 
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing 
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. 

    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties 
    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, 
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified 
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may 
    appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified 
    without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. 

    f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this 
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention 
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on 
    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright 
    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and 
    the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These 
    rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in 
    which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the 
    corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty 
    provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of 
    rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights 
    not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be 
    included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the 
    license of any rights under applicable law.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
     the version number 2.1.]

                                Preamble

      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
    these things.

      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
    there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
    introduced by others.
    
      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
    restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
    ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
    libraries into non-free programs.

      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
    the library.

      We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.

      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
    a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
    free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
    system.

      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
    that program using a modified version of the Library.

      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.
    
                      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
    Each licensee is addressed as "you".

      A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

      The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".)

      "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the library.

      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
    and what the program that uses the Library does.

      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.

      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.

        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function must
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
        root function must still compute square roots.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
    it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Library.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.

      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
    these notices.
    
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
    the Library into a program that is not a library.

      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.

      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

      However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

      When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
    Library will still fall under Section 6.)

      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    
      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.

      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
    of these things:

        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
        to use the modified definitions.)

        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
        will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
        the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
        interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
        least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.

        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
        specified materials from the same place.

        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

      For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
    the executable.

      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
    distribute.
    
      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.

        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Library or works based on it.

      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
    this License.
    
      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.

      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.

      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
    
      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
    ordinary General Public License).

      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
        version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
        Lesser General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

         non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
         claims:
              (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
              trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
              modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
              Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
              as part of a Larger Work; and

              (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
              selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
              sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
              Original Code (or portions thereof).

              (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
              effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
              Original Code under the terms of this License.

              (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
              granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
              separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
              by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
              combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

              (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
              trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
              display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
              created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
              unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
              and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

              (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
              selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
              and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
              of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
              made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
              Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
              Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
              Version (or portions of such combination).

              (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are

              the Covered Code.

              (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
              granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
              Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
              3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
              Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
              by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
              Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
              infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
              that Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

         3.1. Application of License.
         The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
         governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
         Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
         distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
         of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
         copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
         distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
         version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
         License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
         an additional document offering the additional rights described in
         Section 3.5.

         3.2. Availability of Source Code.
         Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
         made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
         either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
         Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
         months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
         (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
         has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
         ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

         3.3. Description of Modifications.
         You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
         file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
         the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
         the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
         Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
         Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
         Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
         origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

         3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
              (a) Third Party Claims.
              If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
              intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
              granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
              Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
              distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
              party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
              know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
              the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
              Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
              Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
              (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
              reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
              Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

              (b) Contributor APIs.
              If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
              interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
              are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
              also include this information in the LEGAL file.

                   (c)    Representations.
              Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
              Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
              Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
              Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
              this License.

         3.5. Required Notices.
         You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
         Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
         Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
         location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
         to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
         You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
         Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
         for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
         rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
         charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
         obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
         may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
         any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
         offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
         Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
         Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
         support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

         3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
         You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
         requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
         and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
         the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
         including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
         obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
         in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
         collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
         Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
         Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
         contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
         compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
         Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
         rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
         License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
         license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
         from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
         Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
         the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
         terms You offer.

         3.7. Larger Works.
         You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
         not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
         Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
         requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

         If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
         License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
         statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
         the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
         describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
         must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
         be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
         extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
         sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
         understand it.

    5. Application of this License.

         This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
         attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

    6. Versions of the License.

         6.1. New Versions.
         Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
         and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
         will be given a distinguishing version number.

         6.2. Effect of New Versions.
         Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
         License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
         version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
         of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
         other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
         Covered Code created under this License.

         6.3. Derivative Works.
         If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
         only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
         governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
         the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
         "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
         license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
         and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
         contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
         Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
         Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
         Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
         this License.)

    7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

         COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
         WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
         DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
         THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
         IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
         YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
         COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
         OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
         ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

    8. TERMINATION.

         8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
         automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
         such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
         sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
         survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
         nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
         shall survive.

         8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
         claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
         or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
         You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

         (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
         infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
         Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
         shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
         unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
         agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
         royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
         Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
         the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
         of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
         mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
         is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
         Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
         the 60 day notice period specified above.

         (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
         Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
         any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
         and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
         sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
         Participant.

         8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
         alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
         indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
         by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
         infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
         granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
         into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
         license.

         8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
         all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
         which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
         prior to termination shall survive termination.

    9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

         UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
         (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
         DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
         OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
         ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
         CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
         WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
         COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
         INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
         LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
         RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
         PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
         EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
         THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

         The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
         48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
         software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
         terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
         C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
         all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
         rights set forth herein.

    11. MISCELLANEOUS.

         This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
         matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
         unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
         necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
         California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
         any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.

         California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
         without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
         expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
         Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
         Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
         shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
         License.
